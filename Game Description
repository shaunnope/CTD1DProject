Game Rules

1. On a rubik's cube, each face is an empty tic-tac-toe board
2. On your turn, you may choose to place your mark ("x" or "o") on any of the boards
3. When you win on a board, you may choose to rotate the cube in any direction
  3a. If your rotation breaks the winning row on any board, the win is no longer valid and the game on that board continues
  3b. If your rotation creates a winning row on any board, the player whom the mark belongs to wins on that board
4. The overall winner of the game is the first that gets 4 3-in-a-row (can be on the same board)
